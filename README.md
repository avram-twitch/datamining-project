# Data Mining Class Project

## Collaborators

## Assignment Overview

A collaborative for project for CS 6140 for Spring 2019.
The goal is to perform data mining on some real data set, 
with the goal to gain in depth experience in some aspect of the class,
in a setting where the instructor can give guidance.
The student is meant to demonstrate a deep understanding of some aspect of data mining.

## Data

We intend to apply data mining on the [Million Song dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/). 
Specifically, we plan to data mine the lyrics, musical characteristics (e.g. tempo), artist, year, and genres data. 

## Structure

In musical criticism, there are commonly accepted narratives as to how certain
artists or genres influence each other. We want to see if there exists
a quantifiable structure to these influences. We will do this by examining
similarities in lyrics and musical characteristics such as tempo, to see if
relationships exist between artists, genres, and the year, that coincides
with these commonly accepted narratives.

## Motivation

This problem is interesting on a few different fronts, but we will be focusing on two. 

First, this examination can potentially give insight on how human beings
interact, collaborate, borrow, steal, or draw inspiration from each other.

Second, it may offer insights on the evolution of music throughout the years.
Using the time data, we could potentially see how these things shift.
