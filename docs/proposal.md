# Data Mining Project Proposal

### Group

### Data

We intend to apply data mining on the Million Song dataset. Specifically, we
plan to data mine the lyrics, musical characteristics (e.g. tempo), artist,
year, and genres data. This data, and associated sub-datasets, can be found at
https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/. 

### Structure

In musical criticism, there are commonly accepted narratives as to how certain
artists or genres influence each other. We want to see if there exists
a quantifiable structure to these influences. We will do this by examining
similarities in lyrics and musical characteristics such as tempo, to see if
relationships exist between artists, genres, and the year, that coincides
with these commonly accepted narratives.


### Value

This problem is interesting on a few different fronts, but we will be focusing on two. 

First, this examination can potentially give insight on how human beings
interact, collaborate, borrow, steal, or draw inspiration from each other.

Second, it may offer insights on the evolution of music throughout the years.
Using the time data, we could potentially see how these things shift.


### Instructor Value

I think that this may be an interesting application of finding "structure" in an
organic, human network. I also think that this may be a bit more of an advanced
investigation of clustering, and potentially including multiple ways that the
network can be compared (artist vs genre vs year) may provide interesting
insights.
