% Requirements:
% 1.  Provide a succinct title for your project (and your names!).
%       This is part of 4 pages/student.
%       Your poster must have the same title.
% 2.  Explain the problem and motivation.
%       If you prepared a thorough proposal and intermediate report,
%       then you may be able to borrow some material from there.
% 3.  Explain what data you explored? 
%       Where did it come from, how did you process it? 
%       If you simulated toscale the experiments, how did this work? 
%       If your data collection report was thorough, you can likelyreuse much of this material.
% 4.  What is the key idea your project is built upon?
%       If there is no interesting ideas,  I will be a little disappointed. 
%       This should describe the rational behind and what you were hoping to discover
%       about the different approaches you are comparing,
%       or what extension you are proposing to a existing technique, 
%       or how you are applying a technique to a dataset where it has not been explored before.
%       State this clearly in the beginning; try to make me excited to read the remainder
%       of your report to find out how your idea played out!
% 5.  Explain what you did.
%       Did you prove something?  
%       Did you implement something?
%       Did you compare several things?
%       Did you extend something?
% 6.  Explain what you learned.
%       This is often greatly aided through charts of experiments.
%       But you shouldalso include what lessons you came away with in words; just charts or mathematics is insufficient.
